Imagine the final moments of a championship match, a perfectly executed team fight that secures victory for Neumont’s Esports team. The casters are ecstatic, the players are celebrating, and the audience is roaring. Capturing this moment for promotional highlights and tactical review is crucial, but the caster’s PC, burdened by recording software and the game itself, suddenly crashes. Precious content is lost forever. This scenario exemplifies a critical vulnerability in our current infrastructure. 
The Neumont Esports server is designed to be the definitive solution to this problem. This project proposes the deployment of a dedicated, high-capacity network server that will serve as a centralized repository for all Esports media. The proposed solution is a dedicated video storage server with 20 terabytes of capacity, designed specifically for the Neumont Esports program. It will function as an always available network drive, allowing casters to record matches directly to its massive storage, enabling players and coaches to instantly access and analyze gameplay footage from any station in the lab, and providing the marketing team with a curated library of high-quality content straight from the source. By offloading the massive file sizes of 4K video recordings from individual gaming PCs, the media server ensures that system resources are dedicated to what matters most to players by delivering peak performance in competition and preserving the digital legacy of our teams. This is the challenge the media storage server is designed to solve.
My solution addresses a critical gap in current Esports structure. While the existing gaming PCs come with 1TB of storage, this space is already heavily filled by essential gaming software and required program software. Once players or casters record video footage, that limited space quickly disappears, causing slowdowns and forcing users to delete files they might otherwise review later. 
By providing a dedicated storage solution, I’m not just adding capacity, I’m creating a system that serves two vital functions. First, I seek to preserve crucial gameplay footage for team improvement and supporting Neumont's marketing team through organized media management. By creating a dedicated storage server, the Esports program not only mirrors industry practices but also ensures cost-effectiveness by avoiding the unnecessary expense of professional-grade systems while still gaining the benefits of shared storage. Unlike traditional cloud storage solutions that can be slow and unreliable for large video files, the server provides instant access to footage when teams need it most.
Existing solutions like Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive are inadequate for this specific use case. As noted by industry experts, these platforms often suffer from synchronization delays, file size limitations, and potential bandwidth throttling, creating a bottleneck when transferring multi-gigabyte video files. Furthermore, cloud services incur recurring subscription costs that grow exponentially with storage needs. By creating this centralized server for all Esports media, we not only solve the storage problem but also fundamentally enhance the collaborative workflow between players, coaches, and marketers.
Second, the implementation of this storage server is supported by research in both sports analytics and digital asset management. The real value of this server lies in what it enables—coaching, collaboration, and promotion. For Esports athletes, video review is widely recognized as one of the most effective methods for improving competitive performance. Research on structured video analysis in Esports has demonstrated measurable improvements in strategic decision-making, team coordination, and tactical execution when teams consistently review recorded gameplay (Himmelstein et al., 2017; Smith, 2022). For Neumont, this translates into a direct educational benefit, allowing players to refine their skills through structured review while enabling coaches to develop targeted strategies based on real match data (Freeman & Wohn, 2017).
Beyond training, the server provides a critical resource for marketing and recruitment. Esports programs thrive on visibility, and the ability to efficiently archive and retrieve high-quality video content simplifies the creation of highlight reels, promotional materials, and social media content. According to the Entertainment Software Association, 72% of prospective students are more likely to consider a university that actively supports competitive gaming (ESA, 2024). Additionally, research in digital asset management indicates that centralized storage solutions significantly reduce the risk of data loss compared to distributed storage methods, further reinforcing the long-term value of this infrastructure investment. By providing a dedicated storage solution, Neumont is not only addressing an immediate technical limitation but also investing in the sustained competitive, educational, and promotional success of its Esports program.
